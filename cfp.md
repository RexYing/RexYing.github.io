**Submission deadline:** Friday, 26 Feb 2021 (23:59 AoE)<br> 

**Author notification:** Friday, 26 March 2021

**Camera ready deadline:** Monday, 6 July 2020 (23:59 AoE)

**Workshop:** TBD<br>
The workshop will be held **virtually** due to risks and travel restrictions associated with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. For more information from ICLR, please see the [ICLR conference website](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2021).

You may submit your paper through **CMT**, by following [this link](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SimDL2021/).

We encourage submissions related to learning simulation using deep learning. We will especially appreciate submissions that connect directly with the topics of the workshop, as well as papers that introduce interdisciplinary applications and benchmarks.

We will welcome original research papers of no more than 4 pages, not including references or supplementary materials. We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings) that do not fit in the 4 pages. 

All accepted papers will be presented in the virtual poster session, with three contributed works, being selected for an oral presentation. 

All submissions must use the [ICLR template](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/archive/iclr2021.zip). Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable.

Should you have any questions, please reach out to us via email:<br>
